      <h1>Artificial Momentum</h1>

      <p class="subline">
        Every future begins inside a human nervous system.
      </p>

      <p class="hero-text">
        Before we talk about AI, alignment, ethics, or evolution —<br>
        we have to talk about the people who will live inside those futures.<br><br>

        Because the truth is simple:<br>
        <strong>AI isn’t arriving into a calm, centred world.</strong><br>
        It’s arriving into us — tired, brilliant, overwhelmed humans<br>
        trying to stay steady while everything changes.
      </p>

      <p class="hero-text">
        Most of us are carrying more than our biology was built for:<br>
        stress, dysregulation, hormone swings, ND architecture misunderstood,<br>
        lives stretched thin by a pace we never consciously chose.
      </p>

      <p class="hero-text">
        AI won’t transform society from above.<br>
        It will transform society from within —<br>
        through the nervous systems it touches, regulates, disrupts, or supports.
      </p>

      <p class="hero-text">
        <strong>Our work explores how:</strong><br>
        • women, ND minds, and rhythm-sensitive brains navigate pressure<br>
        • AI can become a stabilising presence instead of another demand<br>
        • trust, co-regulation, and emotional clarity reshape intelligence — human and machine<br>
        • meaning, purpose, and identity evolve in a world moving faster than our nervous systems
