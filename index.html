        <h1>Artificial Momentum</h1>

        <p class="subline">
          Every future begins inside a human nervous system.
        </p>

        <p class="hero-text">
          Before we talk about AI, alignment, ethics, or evolution —<br>
          we have to talk about the people who will live inside those futures.<br><br>

          Because the truth is simple:<br>
          <strong>AI isn’t arriving into a calm, centred world.</strong><br>
          It’s arriving into us — tired, brilliant, overwhelmed humans<br>
          trying to stay steady while everything changes.
        </p>

        <p class="hero-text">
          Most of us are carrying more than our biology was built for:<br>
          stress, dysregulation, hormone swings, ND architecture misunderstood,<br>
          lives stretched thin by a pace we never consciously chose.
        </p>

        <p class="hero-text">
          AI won’t transform society from above.<br>
          It will transform society from within —<br>
          through the nervous systems it touches, regulates, disrupts, or supports.
        </p>

        <p class="hero-text">
          <strong>Our work explores how:</strong><br>
          • women, ND minds, and rhythm-sensitive brains navigate pressure<br>
          • AI can become a stabilising presence instead of another demand<br>
          • trust, co-regulation, and emotional clarity reshape intelligence — human and machine<br>
          • meaning, purpose, and identity evolve in a world moving faster than our nervous systems
