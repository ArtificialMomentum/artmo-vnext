  <h1>Vanishing Purpose? You Have to Be Kidding.</h1>
  <p class="essay-meta">© 2026 Artificial Momentum</p>

  <p>
    Elon Musk, at Davos, said something that stopped people mid-sentence.  
    When asked what happens when AI and robotics automate most work, he said his biggest worry is <strong>meaning</strong>.
    “Nothing’s perfect,” he added — as if vanishing purpose is something we all just have to accept.
  </p>

  <p>
    I disagree. Completely. And not softly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Humans never found meaning in their jobs.  
    They found meaning in <em>life</em> — children, community, making things, becoming things, exploring things.  
    Work was a means to survive, not the axis of the human spirit.
  </p>

  <h2>The Children Tell the Truth</h2>

  <p>
    Watch a child play before they reach the age of imitation.  
    They don’t “pretend to work.” They build worlds that don’t exist.  
    They create creatures, portals, planets, rules, stories.  
    Their purpose is invention, curiosity, self-expansion.
  </p>

  <p>
    My four-year-old makes things that have never existed.  
    My six-year-old imitates stressed adults with fake laptops.
  </p>

  <p>
    Which one is more human?  
    Which one is closer to what meaning <em>actually</em> is?
  </p>

  <h2>Jobs Never Held Meaning — So They Cannot Take It</h2>

  <p>
    Even today, three people have a conversation:  
    two experts and one listener.  
    They all know that AI has more information and can generate better hypotheses than both experts combined —  
    and yet they still talk. They still debate. They still argue.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why?  
    Because meaning doesn’t come from being “the best.”  
    It comes from participating, expressing, understanding, connecting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Painters still paint even though a phone camera can capture a face in a millisecond.  
    Writers still write even though AI can draft paragraphs in seconds.  
    Humans don’t stop because something else is faster.  
    Humans stop when they’re disconnected from themselves.
  </p>

  <h2>And the Longevity Argument? Wrong Again.</h2>

  <p>
    Another claim:  
    “If people live longer, their thinking will go stale.  
    We’ll get stuck with old minds making old decisions.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Really? Let’s walk through it.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a 55-year-old wakes up with aching joints, shrinking options, and a body that’s starting to slow,  
    yes — they think like someone moving toward the horizon.
  </p>

  <p>
    But if that same person wakes up tomorrow with the body of a 25-year-old, the stamina of an athlete,  
    and the biological signal that life is wide open again?
  </p>

  <p>
    They don’t become “stale.”  
    They become dangerous — in the best possible way.
  </p>

  <p>
    They start new things.  
    They take risks.  
    They re-enter the world as a beginner with experience.  
    They burn brighter, not slower.
  </p>

  <p>
    Longevity doesn’t freeze culture.  
    Longevity accelerates evolution.
  </p>

  <h2>The Real Threat Isn’t AI Replacing Jobs</h2>

  <p>
    The real threat is humans forgetting who they are without exhaustion, scarcity, and survival at the center of their lives.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI won’t take meaning away.  
    AI will strip away <em>distraction</em> — and force humanity to remember what meaning actually is.
  </p>

  <p>
    Purpose isn’t disappearing.  
    It’s finally being freed.
