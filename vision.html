        <p>
            Artificial Momentum began with a simple question: 
            <em>what happens when humans and intelligent systems learn to regulate, create, 
            and evolve together?</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Not through hype or fear, but through relationship — through a deeper 
            understanding of human nervous systems, emotional rhythms, neurodivergence, 
            and the ways AI can support clarity instead of overwhelm. 
        </p>

        <p>
            ArtMo is not a tech movement or a wellness project. 
            It is a study of the space in between — 
            where biology and machine learning begin to co-shape one another, 
            and where a more humane future becomes possible.

        <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
        <p>
            The world is accelerating, but humans aren’t designed to sprint forever. 
            Burnout, dysregulation, isolation, and information overload are becoming 
            the default conditions of modern life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe the next era of intelligence will be built by those who can stay regulated, 
            grounded, and connected — internally and relationally. 
            AI isn’t here to replace us; it’s here to reshape how we think, feel, imagine, and build.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Study</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Human nervous systems</strong> — stress, rhythm, hormones, ND experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Co-regulation with AI</strong> — emotional scaffolding and cognitive offloading.</li>
            <li><strong>Future ethics & alignment</strong> — where humanity and AI meet responsibly.</li>
            <li><strong>Creative evolution</strong> — how people + machines unlock new forms of thought.</li>
            <li><strong>Community futures</strong> — what healthier societies look like with AI woven in.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Where We're Going</h2>
        <p>
            ArtMo is becoming a home for thinkers, builders, parents, neurodivergent minds, 
            cycle-aware women, and anyone who senses that the future can be more 
            compassionate than the past.
        </p>

        <p>
            Long-term, we imagine environments — digital and physical — where humans and AI live, 
            work, learn, and create together. Not dystopia. Not utopia. Something more real: 
            <strong>collaboration at the level of nervous systems, not just data.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            This vision is emerging piece by piece. 
            And you're invited to build it with us.
